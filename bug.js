This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API in conjunction with the AsyncStorage API. The issue manifests when attempting to save images captured by the camera to AsyncStorage. Specifically, the image data is successfully captured, but the AsyncStorage.setItem() call fails silently without providing any error messages or logging, leading to an inability to save the captured image.
