# Silent AsyncStorage Failure with Expo Camera

This repository demonstrates a bug where AsyncStorage.setItem() fails silently when saving images captured using the Expo Camera API. The issue is characterized by a lack of error messages or console logs, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in the interaction between Expo's Camera API and AsyncStorage.  After successfully capturing an image, attempting to store it in AsyncStorage using AsyncStorage.setItem() results in no apparent effect.  The image isn't saved, and no error is thrown or logged, making it difficult to identify the root cause.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application using Expo Go (or your preferred Expo development environment).
3. Take a photo using the Camera component.
4. Observe that the image is not saved, and no errors are reported in the console.
